              Our Journey Since 2025
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Founded in 2025, DiaryFood emerged from a simple yet powerful
              vision: to revolutionize how people interact with cooking and
              recipes. What started as a small community of passionate home
              cooks has grown into a vibrant platform that connects food
              enthusiasts from all walks of life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our platform combines cutting-edge AI technology with the warmth
              of community sharing. We've helped thousands of users discover
              their passion for cooking, from complete beginners to seasoned
              chefs. Through our innovative features like smart recipe
              suggestions, ingredient substitutions, and step-by-step cooking
              guides, we've made cooking more accessible and enjoyable for
              everyone.
